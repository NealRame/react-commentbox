ReactJS Comment Box
===================

This is an implementation of the **React JS** tutorial which explain how to
build a comment box using **React JS**. We also use **Express.js** and
**Mongoose**. See the
[React JS Tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html) page for
more details.

We will provide:
- a view of all the comments,
- a form to submit a comment,
- some hooks to provide a custom backend,
- _**optimistic commenting**_:
comments appear in the list before they're saved on the server so it feels
fast,
- _**live updates**_: as other users comments we will pop them into the comment
view in real time,
- _**markdown formatting**_: users can use markdown to format their text.
